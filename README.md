ðŸ“„ Project Overview
Clerk is a custom account system for Minecraft designed to unify Java and Bedrock players under any username they choose by running Velocity in offline mode. It stores credentials securely in PostgreSQL and offers robust protection against bruteâ€‘force and suspicious login attempts. Written in Kotlin, Clerk integrates smoothly with Velocity, Folia, and Minestom to enable seamless crossâ€‘play.
